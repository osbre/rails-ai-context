# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **New models now discovered via filesystem fallback** — when `ActiveRecord::Base.descendants` misses a newly created model, the introspector scans `app/models/*.rb` and constantizes them. Fixes model invisibility until MCP restart.
- **Devise meta-methods no longer fill class/instance method caps** — filtered 40+ Devise-generated methods (authentication_keys=, email_regexp=, password_required?, etc.). Source-defined methods now prioritized over reflection-discovered ones.
- **Controller `unless:`/`if:` conditions now extracted** — filters like `before_action :authenticate_user!, unless: :devise_controller?` now show the condition. Previously silently dropped.
- **Empty string defaults shown as `""`** — schema tool now renders `""` instead of a blank cell for empty string defaults. AI can distinguish "no default" from "empty string default".
- **Implicit belongs_to validations labeled** — `presence on user` from `belongs_to :user` now shows `_(implicit from belongs_to)_` and filters phantom `(message: required)` options.
- **Array columns shown as `type[]`** in generated rules — `string` columns with `array: true` now render as `string[]` in schema rules.
- **External ID columns no longer hidden** — columns like `paymongo_checkout_id` and `stripe_payment_id` are now shown in schema rules. Only conventional Rails FK columns (matching a table name) are filtered.
- **Column defaults shown in generated rules** — columns with non-nil defaults now show `(=value)` inline.
- **`analyze_feature` matches models by table name and underscore form** — `feature:"share"` now finds `CookShare` (via `cook_shares` table and `cook_share` underscore form), not just exact model name substring.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Design system extraction** — ViewTemplateIntrospector now extracts canonical page examples (real HTML/ERB snippets from actual views), full color palette with semantic roles (primary/danger/success/warning), typography scale (sizes, weights, heading styles), layout patterns (containers, grids, spacing scale), responsive breakpoint usage, interactive state patterns (hover/focus/active/disabled), dark mode detection, and icon system identification.
- **New MCP tool: `rails_get_design_system`** — dedicated tool (15th) returns the app's design system: color palette, component patterns with real HTML examples, typography, layout conventions, responsive breakpoints. Supports `detail` parameter (summary/standard/full). Total MCP tools: 15.
- **DesignSystemHelper serializer module** — replaces flat component listings with actionable design guidance across all output formats (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, OpenCode). Shows components with semantic roles, canonical page examples in split rules, and explicit design rules.
- **DesignTokenIntrospector semantic categorization** — tokens now grouped into colors/typography/spacing/sizing/borders/shadows. Enhanced Tailwind v3 parsing for fontSize, spacing, borderRadius, and screens.

### Changed

- **"UI Patterns" section renamed to "Design System"** — richer content with color palette, typography, components, spacing conventions, interactive states, and design rules.
- **Design tokens consumed for the first time** — `context[:design_tokens]` data was previously extracted but never rendered. Now merged into design system output in all serializers and the new MCP tool.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Full-preset stack overview in all serializers** — compact mode now surfaces summary lines for auth, Hotwire/Turbo, API, I18n, ActiveStorage, ActionText, assets, engines, and multi-database in generated context files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .windsurfrules, and all split rules). Previously this data was only available via MCP tools.
- **`rails_analyze_feature` in all tool reference sections** — the 14th tool (added in v1.0.0) was missing from serializer output. Now listed in all generated files across Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and OpenCode formats.

### Fixed

- **Tool count corrected from 13 to 14** across all serializers to reflect `rails_analyze_feature` added in v1.0.0.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- **Default preset changed to `:full`** — all 28 introspectors now run by default, giving AI assistants richer context out of the box. Introspectors that don't find relevant data return empty hashes with zero overhead. Use `config.preset = :standard` for the previous 13-core default.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **New composite tool: `rails_analyze_feature`** — one call returns schema + models + controllers + routes for a feature area (e.g., `rails_analyze_feature(feature:"authentication")`). Total MCP tools: 14.
- **Custom tool registration API** — `config.custom_tools << MyCompany::PolicyCheckTool` lets teams extend the MCP server with their own tools.
- **Structured error responses with fuzzy suggestions** — `not_found_response` helper in BaseTool with "Did you mean?" fuzzy matching (substring + prefix) and `recovery_action` hints. Applied to schema, models, controllers, and stimulus lookups. AI agents self-correct on first retry.
- **Cache keys on paginated responses** — every paginated response includes `cache_key` from fingerprint so agents detect stale data between page fetches. Applied to schema, models, controllers, and stimulus pagination.

### Changed

- **LLM-optimized tool descriptions (all 14 tools)** — every description now follows "what it does / Use when: / key params" format so AI agents pick the right tool on first try.

## [0.15.10] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

- **Gemspec description rewritten** — repositioned from feature list to value proposition: mental model, semantic validation, cross-file error detection.

## [0.15.9] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Deep diagnostic checks in `rails ai:doctor`** — upgraded from 13 shallow file-existence checks to 20 deep checks: pending migrations, context file freshness, .mcp.json validation, introspector health (dry-runs each one), preset coverage (detects features not in preset), .env/.master.key gitignore check, auto_mount production warning, schema/view size vs limits.

## [0.15.8] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Semantic validation (`level:"rails"`)** — `rails_validate` now supports `level:"rails"` for deep semantic checks beyond syntax: partial existence, route helper validity, column references vs schema, strong params vs schema columns, callback method existence, route-action consistency, `has_many` dependent options, missing FK indexes, and Stimulus controller file existence.

## [0.15.7] - 2026-03-22

### Improved

- **Hybrid filter extraction** — controller filters now use reflection for complete names (handles inheritance + skips), with source parsing from the inheritance chain for only/except constraints.
- **Callback source fallback** — when reflection returns nothing (e.g. CI), falls back to parsing callback declarations from model source files.
- **ERB validation accuracy** — in-process compilation with `<%=` → `<%` pre-processing and yield wrapper eliminates false positives from block-form helpers.
- **Schema static parser** — now extracts `null: false`, `default:`, `array: true` from schema.rb columns, and parses `add_foreign_key` declarations.
- **Array column display** — schema tool shows PostgreSQL array types as `string[]`, `integer[]`, etc.
- **Concern test lookup** — `rails_get_test_info(model:"PlanLimitable")` searches concern test paths.
- **Controller flexible matching** — underscore-based normalization handles CamelCase, snake_case, and slash notation consistently.

## [0.15.6] - 2026-03-22

### Added

- **7 new configurable options** — `excluded_controllers`, `excluded_route_prefixes`, `excluded_concerns`, `excluded_filters`, `excluded_middleware`, `search_extensions`, `concern_paths` for stack-specific customization.
- **Configurable file size limits** — `max_file_size`, `max_test_file_size`, `max_schema_file_size`, `max_view_total_size`, `max_view_file_size`, `max_search_results`, `max_validate_files` all exposed via `Configuration`.
- **Class methods in model detail** — `rails_get_model_details` now shows class methods section.
- **Custom validate methods** — `validate :method_name` calls extracted from source and shown in model detail.

### Fixed

- **Schema defaults always visible** — Null and Default columns always shown (NOT NULL marked bold). Previous token-saving logic accidentally hid critical migration data.
- **Optional associations** — `belongs_to` with `optional: true` now shows `[optional]` flag.
- **Concern methods inline** — shows public methods from concern source files (e.g. `PlanLimitable — can_cook?, increment_cook_count!`).
- **MCP tool error messages** — all tools now show available values on error/not-found for AI self-correction.

## [0.15.5] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **ERB validation** — now catches missing `<% end %>` by compiling ERB to Ruby then syntax-checking the result (was only checking ERB tag syntax).
- **Controller namespace format** — accepts both `Bonus::CrisesController` and `bonus/crises` (cross-tool consistency).
- **Layouts discoverable** — `controller:"layouts"` now works in view tool.
- **Validate error detail** — Ruby shows up to 5 error lines, JS shows 3 (was truncated to 1).
- **Invalid/empty regex** — early validation with clear error messages instead of silent fail.
- **Route count accuracy** — shows filtered count when `app_only:true`, not unfiltered total.
- **Namespace test lookup** — supports `bonus/crises` format and flat test directories.
- **Empty inputs** — `near:""` in edit_context and `pattern:""` in search return helpful errors.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **View subfolder paths** — listings now show full relative paths (`bonus/brand_profiles/index.html.erb`) instead of just basenames.
- **Controller flexible matching** — `"cooks"`, `"CooksController"`, `"cookscontroller"` all resolve (matches other tools' forgiving lookup).
- **View path traversal** — explicit `..` and absolute path rejection before any filesystem operation.
- **Schema case-insensitive** — table lookup now case-insensitive (matches models/routes/etc.).
- **limit:0 silent empty** — uses default instead of returning empty results.
- **offset past end** — shows "Use `offset:0` to start over" instead of empty response.
- **Search ordering** — deterministic results via `--sort=path` on ripgrep.
- **Generated context prepended** — `<!-- BEGIN rails-ai-context -->` section now placed at top of existing files (AI reads top-to-bottom, may truncate at token limits).

### Added

- **Pagination on models, controllers, stimulus** — `limit`/`offset` params (default 50) with "end of results" hints. Prevents token bombs on large apps.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Schema `add_index` column parsing** — option keys (e.g. `unique`, `name`) were being picked up as column names (PR #12).
- **Windsurf test command** — extracted `TestCommandDetection` shared module; Windsurf now shows specific test command instead of generic "Run tests after changes".

### Changed

- **Documentation** — updated all docs (README, CLAUDE.md, GUIDE.md, SECURITY.md, CHANGELOG, server.json, install generator) to match v0.15.x codebase. Fixed spec counts, file counts, preset counts, config options, and supported versions.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Test command detection** — Serializers now use detected test framework (minitest → `rails test`, rspec → `bundle exec rspec`) instead of hardcoding `bundle exec rspec`. Default is `rails test` (the Rails default). Contributed by @curi (PR #13).

## [0.15.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- **Copilot serializer** — Show all model associations (not capped at 3), use human-readable architecture/pattern labels.
- **OpenCode rules serializer** — Filter framework controllers (Devise) from AGENTS.md output, show all associations, match `before_action` with `!`/`?` suffixes.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-22

### Security

- **Sensitive file blocking** — `search_code` and `get_edit_context` now block access to `.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `config/master.key`, `config/credentials.yml.enc`. Configurable via `config.sensitive_patterns`.
- **Credentials key names redacted** — Replaced `credentials_keys` (exposed names like `stripe_secret_key`) with `credentials_configured` boolean. No more information disclosure via JSON output or MCP resources.
- **View content size cap** — `collect_all_view_content` capped at 5MB total / 500KB per file to prevent memory exhaustion.
- **Schema file size limits** — 10MB limit on `schema.rb`/`structure.sql` parsing. Cached `schema.rb` reads to avoid re-reading per table.

### Added

- **Token optimization (~1,500-2,700 tokens/session saved)**:
  - Filter framework filters (`verify_authenticity_token`, etc.) from controller output
  - Filter framework/gem concerns (`Devise::*`, `Turbo::*`, `*::Generated*`) from models
  - Combine duplicate PUT/PATCH routes into single `PATCH|PUT` entry
  - Only show Nullable/Default columns when they have meaningful values
  - Drop gem version numbers from default output
  - Single HTML naming hint for Stimulus (not per-controller)
  - Only show non-default middleware and initializers in config
  - Group sibling controllers/routes with identical structure
  - Compress repeated Tailwind classes in view full output
  - Strip inline SVGs from view content
  - Separate active vs lifecycle-only Stimulus controllers

### Fixed

- **Controller staleness** — Source-file parsing for actions/filters instead of Ruby reflection. Filesystem discovery for new controllers not yet loaded as classes.
- **Schema `t.index` format** — Parse indexes inside `create_table` blocks (not just `add_index` outside).
- **Stimulus nested values** — Brace-depth counting for single-line `{ active: { type: String, default: "overview" } }`.
- **Stimulus phantom `type:Number`** — Exclude `type`/`default` as value names (JS keywords, not Stimulus values).
- **Search context_lines** — Use `--field-context-separator=:` for ripgrep `-C` output compatibility.
- **Schema defaults** — Supplement live DB nil defaults with values from `schema.rb`.
- **Config missing data** — Added `queue_adapter` and `mailer` settings to config introspector and tool.
- **View garbled fields** — Only extract from `@variable.field` patterns (not arbitrary method chains).
- **View shared partials** — `controller:"shared"` now finds partials in `app/views/shared/`.
- **View full detail** — Lists available controllers when no controller specified.
- **Edit context hint** — "Also found" only shown for matches outside the context window.
- **Model file structure** — Compressed to single-line format.
- **Strong params body** — Action detail now shows the actual `permit(...)` call.
- **AR-generated methods** — Filter `build_*`, `*_ids=`, etc. from model instance methods.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Schema 0 indexes** — Fixed composite index parsing in schema.rb (regex didn't match array syntax) and structure.sql (`.first` only took first column). Both single and composite indexes now extracted correctly.
- **Stale routes after editing routes.rb** — Route introspector now calls `routes_reloader.execute_if_updated` to force Rails to reload routes before extraction.
- **Config "not available"** — Added `:config` to `:standard` preset. Was `:full` only, so default users never saw config data.
- **Stimulus values lost name** — Fixed parsing for both simple (`name: Type`) and complex (`name: { type: Type, default: val }`) formats. Now shows `max: Number (default: 3)`.
- **Model concerns noise** — Filtered out internal Rails modules (ActiveRecord::, ActiveModel::, Kernel, JSON::, etc.) from concerns list.

### Added

- **Route helpers in standard detail** — `rails_get_routes(detail: "standard")` now includes route helper names alongside paths.
- **`app_only` filter for routes** — `rails_get_routes(app_only: true)` (default) hides internal Rails routes (Active Storage, Action Mailbox, Conductor).
- **Search context lines** — `rails_search_code(context_lines: 2)` adds surrounding lines to matches (passes `-C` to ripgrep).
- **Stimulus dash/underscore normalization** — Both `weekly-chart` and `weekly_chart` work for controller lookup. Output shows HTML `data-controller` attribute.
- **Model public method signatures** — `rails_get_model_details(model: "Cook")` shows method names with params from source, stopping at private boundary.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- **View summary** — now shows partials used by each view.
- **Model details** — shows method signatures (name + parameters) instead of just method names.
- Removed unused demo files; fixed GUIDE.md preset tables.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **`rails_validate` MCP tool** — batch syntax validation for Ruby, ERB, and JavaScript files. Replaces separate `ruby -c`, ERB check, and `node -c` calls. Returns pass/fail for each file with error details. Uses `Open3.capture2e` (no shell execution). Falls back to brace-matching when Node.js is unavailable.
- **Model constants extraction** — introspects `STATUSES = %w[...]` style constants and includes them in model context.
- **Global before_actions in controller rules** — OpenCode AGENTS.md now shows ApplicationController before_actions.
- **Service objects and jobs listed** — OpenCode controller AGENTS.md now lists service objects and background jobs.
- **Validate spec** — 8 tests covering happy path, syntax errors, path traversal, MAX_FILES, unsupported types.

### Security

- **Validate tool uses Open3 array form** — no shell execution for `ruby -c`, ERB compilation, or `node -c`. Fixed critical shell quoting bug in ERB validation that caused it to always fail.
- **File size limit** on JavaScript fallback validation (2MB).
- **`which node` check uses array form** — `system("which", "node")` instead of shell string.

### Fixed

- ERB validation was broken due to shell quoting bug (backticks + nested quotes). Replaced with `Open3.capture2e("ruby", "-e", script, ARGV[0])`.
- Rubocop offenses in validate.rb (18 spacing issues auto-corrected).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Design Token Introspector** — auto-detects CSS framework and extracts tokens from Tailwind v3/v4, Bootstrap/Sass, plain CSS custom properties, Webpacker-era stylesheets, and ViewComponent sidecar CSS. Tested across 8 CSS setups. Added to standard preset.
- **`rails_get_edit_context` MCP tool** — purpose-built for surgical edits. Returns code around a match point with line numbers. Replaces the Read + Edit workflow with a single call.
- **Line numbers in action source** — `rails_get_controllers(action: "index")` now returns start/end line numbers for targeted editing.
- **Model file structure** — `rails_get_model_details(model: "Cook")` now returns line ranges for each section (associations, validations, scopes, etc.).

### Changed

- **MCP instructions updated** — "Use MCP for reference files (schema, routes, tests). Read directly if you'll edit." Prevents unnecessary double-reads.
- **UI pattern extractor rewritten** — semantic labels (primary/secondary/danger), deduplication, 12+ component types, color scheme + radius + form layout extraction, framework-agnostic.
- **Schema rules include column types** — `status:string, intake:jsonb` instead of just names. Also shows foreign keys, indexes, and enum values.
- **View standard detail enhanced** — shows partial fields, helper methods, and shared partials.

### Security

- **File.realpath symlink protection** on all file-reading tools (get_view, get_edit_context, get_test_info, search_code).
- **File size limits** — 2MB on controllers/models/views, 500KB on test files.
- **Ripgrep flag injection prevention** — `--` separator before user pattern.
- **Nil guards** on all component rendering across 10 serializers.
- **Non-greedy regex** — ReDoS prevention in card/input/label pattern matching.
- **UTF-8 encoding safety** — all File.read calls handle binary/non-UTF-8 files gracefully.

### Fixed

- Off-by-one in model structure section line ranges.
- Stimulus sort crash on nil controller name.
- Secondary button picking up disabled states (`cursor-not-allowed`).
- Progress bars misclassified as badges.
- Input detection picking up alert divs instead of actual inputs.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **UI pattern extraction** — scans all views for repeated CSS class patterns. Detects buttons, cards, inputs, labels, badges, links, headings, flashes, alerts. Added to ALL serializers (root files + split rules for Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, OpenCode).
- **View partial structure** — `rails_get_view(detail: "standard")` shows model fields and helper methods used by each partial.
- **Schema column names** — `.claude/rules/rails-schema.md` shows key column names with types, foreign keys, indexes, and enum values. Keeps polymorphic `_type`, STI `type`, and soft-delete `deleted_at` columns.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-03-20

### Security

- **ReDoS protection** — added regex timeout and converted greedy quantifiers to non-greedy across all pattern matching.
- **File size limits** — added size caps on parsed files to prevent memory exhaustion from oversized inputs.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- Patch release for RubyGems republish (no code changes).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`rails_get_view` MCP tool** — get view template contents, partials, Stimulus references. Filter by controller or specific path. Supports summary/standard/full detail levels. Eliminates reading 490+ lines of view files per task. ([#7](https://github.com/crisnahine/rails-ai-context/issues/7))
- **`rails_get_stimulus` MCP tool** — get Stimulus controller details (targets, values, actions, outlets, classes). Filter by controller name. Wraps existing StimulusIntrospector. ([#8](https://github.com/crisnahine/rails-ai-context/issues/8))
- **`rails_get_controllers` `action` parameter** — returns actual action source code + applicable filters instead of the entire controller file. Saves ~1,400 tokens per call. ([#9](https://github.com/crisnahine/rails-ai-context/issues/9))
- **`rails_get_test_info` enhanced** — now supports `detail` levels (summary/standard/full), `model` and `controller` params to find existing tests, fixture/factory names, test helper setup. ([#10](https://github.com/crisnahine/rails-ai-context/issues/10))
- **ViewTemplateIntrospector** — new introspector that reads view file contents and extracts partial references and Stimulus data attributes.
- **Stimulus and view_templates in standard preset** — both introspectors now in `:standard` preset (11 introspectors, was 10).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`config.generate_root_files` option** — when set to `false`, skips generating root-level context files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .windsurfrules, copilot-instructions.md, .ai-context.json) while still generating all split rules (.claude/rules/, .cursor/rules/, .windsurf/rules/, .github/instructions/). Defaults to `true`.
- **Section markers on root files** — generated content in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .windsurfrules, and copilot-instructions.md is now wrapped in `<!-- BEGIN rails-ai-context -->` / `<!-- END rails-ai-context -->` markers. User content outside the markers is preserved on re-generation. Existing files without markers get the marked section appended.
- **App overview split rules** — new `rails-context.md` in `.claude/rules/` and `rails-context.instructions.md` in `.github/instructions/` provide a compact app overview (stack, models, routes, gems, architecture) so context is available even when root files are disabled.

### Changed

- **Removed `.cursorrules` root file** — Cursor officially deprecated `.cursorrules` in favor of `.cursor/rules/`. The `:cursor` format now generates only `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` split rules. The `rails-project.mdc` split rule (with `alwaysApply: true`) already provides the project overview.
- **License changed from AGPL-3.0 to MIT** — removes the copyleft blocker for SaaS and commercial projects.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- **Thread-safe shared tool cache** — `BaseTool.cached_context` now uses a Mutex-protected shared cache across all 9 tool subclasses. Previously, each subclass cached independently (up to 9 redundant introspections after invalidation) and had no synchronization for multi-threaded servers like Puma. ([#2](https://github.com/crisnahine/rails-ai-context/issues/2))
- **SearchCode ripgrep total result cap** — `rg --max-count N` limits matches per file, not total. A search with `max_results: 5` against a large codebase could return hundreds of results. Now capped with `.first(max_results)` after parsing, matching the Ruby fallback behavior. ([#3](https://github.com/crisnahine/rails-ai-context/issues/3))
- **JobIntrospector Proc queue fallback** — when a Proc-based `queue_name` raises during introspection, the queue now falls back to `"default"` instead of producing garbage like `"#<Proc:0x00007f...>"`. ([#4](https://github.com/crisnahine/rails-ai-context/issues/4))
- **CLI `version` command crash** — `rails-ai-context version` crashed with `LoadError` due to wrong `require_relative` path (`../rails_ai_context/version` instead of `../lib/rails_ai_context/version`). ([#5](https://github.com/crisnahine/rails-ai-context/issues/5))

### Documentation

- **Standalone CLI documented** — the `rails-ai-context` executable (serve, context, inspect, watch, doctor, version) is now documented in README, GUIDE, and CLAUDE.md.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`structure.sql` support** — the schema introspector now parses `db/structure.sql` when no `db/schema.rb` exists and no database connection is available. Extracts tables, columns (with SQL type normalization), indexes, and foreign keys from PostgreSQL dump format. Prefers `schema.rb` when both exist.
- **Fingerprinter watches `db/structure.sql`** — file changes to `structure.sql` now trigger cache invalidation and live reload.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **License published to RubyGems** — v0.8.2 changed the license from MIT to AGPL-3.0 but the gem was not republished. This release ensures the AGPL-3.0 license is reflected on RubyGems.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- **License** — changed from MIT to AGPL-3.0 to protect against unauthorized clones and ensure derivative works remain open source.
- **CI: auto-publish to MCP Registry** — the release workflow now automatically publishes to the MCP Registry via `mcp-publisher` with GitHub OIDC auth. No manual `mcp-publisher login` + `publish` needed.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **OpenCode support** — generates `AGENTS.md` (native OpenCode context file) plus per-directory `app/models/AGENTS.md` and `app/controllers/AGENTS.md` that OpenCode auto-loads when reading files in those directories. Falls back to `CLAUDE.md` when no `AGENTS.md` exists. New command: `rails ai:context:opencode`.

### Fixed

- **Live reload LoadError in HTTP mode** — when `live_reload = true` and the `listen` gem was missing, the `start_http` method's rescue block (for rackup fallback) swallowed the live reload error, producing a confusing rack error instead of the correct "listen gem required" message. The rescue is now scoped to the rackup require only.
- **Dangling @live_reload reference** — `@live_reload` was assigned before `start` was called. If `start` raised LoadError, the instance variable pointed to a non-functional object. Now only assigned after successful start.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **MCP Live Reload** — when running `rails ai:serve`, file changes automatically invalidate tool caches and send MCP notifications (`notifications/resources/list_changed`) to connected AI clients. The AI's context stays fresh without manual re-querying. Requires the `listen` gem (enabled by default when available). Configurable via `config.live_reload` (`:auto`, `true`, `false`) and `config.live_reload_debounce` (default: 1.5s).
- **Live reload doctor check** — `rails ai:doctor` now warns when the `listen` gem is not installed.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Full MCP tool reference in all context files** — every generated file (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, copilot-instructions.md) now includes complete tool documentation with parameters, detail levels, pagination examples, and usage workflow. Dedicated `rails-mcp-tools` split rule files added for Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and Copilot.
- **MCP Registry listing** — published to the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) as `io.github.crisnahine/rails-ai-context` via mcpb package type.

### Fixed

- **Schema version parsing** — versions with underscores (e.g. `2024_01_15_123456`) were truncated to the first digit group. Now captures the full version string.
- **Documentation** — updated README (detail levels, pagination, generated file tree, config options), SECURITY.md (supported versions), CONTRIBUTING.md (project structure), gemspec (post-install message), demo_script.sh (all 17 generated files).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Detail levels on MCP tools** — `detail:"summary"`, `detail:"standard"` (default), `detail:"full"` on `rails_get_schema`, `rails_get_routes`, `rails_get_model_details`, `rails_get_controllers`. AI calls summary first, then drills down. Based on Anthropic's recommended MCP pattern.
- **Pagination** — `limit` and `offset` parameters on schema and routes tools for apps with hundreds of tables/routes.
- **Response size safety net** — Configurable hard cap (`max_tool_response_chars`, default 120K) on tool responses. Truncated responses include hints to use filters.
- **Compact CLAUDE.md** — New `:compact` context mode (default) generates ≤150 lines per Claude Code's official recommendation. Contains stack overview, key models, and MCP tool usage guide.
- **Full mode preserved** — `config.context_mode = :full` retains the existing full-dump behavior. Also available via `rails ai:context:full` or `CONTEXT_MODE=full`.
- **`.claude/rules/` generation** — Generates quick-reference files in `.claude/rules/` for schema and models. Auto-loaded by Claude Code alongside CLAUDE.md.
- **Cursor MDC rules** — Generates `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files with YAML frontmatter (globs, alwaysApply). Project overview is always-on; model/controller rules auto-attach when working in matching directories. Legacy `.cursorrules` kept for backward compatibility.
- **Windsurf 6K compliance** — `.windsurfrules` is now hard-capped at 5,800 characters (within Windsurf's 6,000 char limit). Generates `.windsurf/rules/*.md` for the new rules format.
- **Copilot path-specific instructions** — Generates `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` with `applyTo` frontmatter for model and controller contexts. Main `copilot-instructions.md` respects compact mode (≤500 lines).
- **`rails ai:context:full` task** — Dedicated rake task for full context dump.
- **Configurable limits** — `claude_max_lines` (default: 150), `max_tool_response_chars` (default: 120K).

### Changed

- Default `context_mode` is now `:compact` (was implicitly `:full`). Existing behavior available via `config.context_mode = :full`.
- Tools default to `detail:"standard"` which returns bounded results, not unlimited.
- All tools return pagination hints when results are truncated.
- `.windsurfrules` now uses dedicated `WindsurfSerializer` instead of sharing `RulesSerializer` with Cursor.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Migrations introspector** — Discovers migration files, pending migrations, recent history, schema version, and migration statistics. Works without DB connection.
- **Seeds introspector** — Analyzes db/seeds.rb structure, discovers seed files in db/seeds/, detects which models are seeded, and identifies patterns (Faker, environment conditionals, find_or_create_by).
- **Middleware introspector** — Discovers custom Rack middleware in app/middleware/, detects patterns (auth, rate limiting, tenant isolation, logging), and categorizes the full middleware stack.
- **Engine introspector** — Discovers mounted Rails engines from routes.rb with paths and descriptions for 23+ known engines (Sidekiq::Web, Flipper::UI, PgHero, ActiveAdmin, etc.).
- **Multi-database introspector** — Discovers multiple databases, replicas, sharding config, and model-specific `connects_to` declarations. Works with database.yml parsing fallback.
- **2 new MCP resources** — `rails://migrations`, `rails://engines`
- **Migrations added to :standard preset** — AI tools now see migration context by default
- **Doctor check** — New `check_migrations` diagnostic
- **Fingerprinter** — Now watches `db/migrate/`, `app/middleware/`, and `config/database.yml`

### Changed

- Default `:standard` preset expanded from 8 to 9 introspectors (added `:migrations`)
- Default `:full` preset expanded from 21 to 26 introspectors
- Doctor checks expanded from 11 to 12
- Static MCP resources expanded from 7 to 9

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
